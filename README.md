<h1 align="center">Early-Stage CKD Prediction</h1>


## Introduction
This study, based on a multicenter retrospective cohort dataset, aims to develop and validate an interpretable ML model for early-stage CKD, quantify key risk factors, and predict early-stage CKD (CKD stages 1-2). The model is designed as a web-based online tool to assist health checkup centers and other non-nephrology specialty outpatient clinics in identifying potential CKD risk patients for follow-up evaluation.


## Code Structure Overview

1. **Data Processing**  
   This part includes dataset loading, and splitting into training, validation, and test sets.  
   ðŸ”§ Reference: [`data_processing.py`](./scripts/data_processing.py)

2. **Model Training and Validation**  
   Includes model training, evaluation of different feature combinations, and internal validation.
   The trained models are exported in `.pkl` format for reproducibility and further application.
   Evaluation metrics include:  Confusion Matrixï¼ŒROC Curve, PR Curve ï¼ŒYoudenâ€™s J index ï¼ŒAccuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC  
   ðŸ”§ Reference: [`model_training.py`](./scripts/model_training.py)

3. **Interpretability Analysis**  
   SHAP is used to interpret feature importance and explain model predictions.  
   ðŸ”§ Reference: [`interpretability.py`](./scripts/interpretability.py)

4. **Other Utilities**  
   Includes statistical significance testing (DeLong test) and k-fold cross-validation procedures.  
   ðŸ”§ Reference: [`other.py`](./scripts/other.py)
